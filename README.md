# Team Project - *Do Güd*

**Do Güd** is an app where users can do random acts of kindness and build kind habits.

## Considerations

What is your product pitch?
- Incentivizing people to do more kind deeds more often

Who are the key stakeholders for this app?
- People who want to become more positive and kind
- People will use the app to build habits of doing acts of kindness

What are the core flows?
- 5 tabs: Homepage, Acts of Kindness Catalogue, Search, Local Needs, Timeline
  1. **Homepage**: User sees the acts of kindness that they choose to work on. Can remove acts from their homepage and add acts to their homepage using the acts of kindness catalogue. User presses a "complete" button on an act when they did it, and the progress level of the act is updated. Clicking on the task opens up a detail view showing more information about the act and the user's progress.
  2. **Acts of Kindness Catalogue**: Contains all acts of kindness, categorized by themes like "Friends" and "Family".
  3. **Search**: User can search for users and view their profiles
  4. (Extended) **Local Needs**: User can view needs in their community using a map with pins. Tapping on a pin allows user to see more details about the need. iUser can add pins to the map.
  5. (Extended) **Timeline**: A public feed showing posts from everyone. User can make posts sharing their experiences relating to acts of kindness they have done or have received.
- User has a profile page showing their name, profile picture, a streak indicating how many days in a row they have done an act of kindness, and badges representing milestones they've hit.

What will your final demo look like?
- Show homepage with some acts of kindness on it. Go to Acts of Kindness Catalogue and add an act to the homepage. Click on an act to see the detail view. Complete an act. View Local Needs map, choose a pin and view its details. Go to the profile and view the daily streak and badges. Go to timeline and make a post about an act of kindness you did.

What mobile features do you leverage?
- **Convenience and mobility of phones**: Everyone always has their phone, so it's easy to open the app and mark the act of kindness you completed right after you did it
- **Maps**: The Local Needs tab uses a map to show needs in the community
